# An introduction to Rails Testing

I ran through the [CodeSchool](www.codeschool.com) Rails Testing course and have uploaded the levels to this repo so I can reference the information later. It contains copies of the same basic rails applications for each level.

All relevant information is basically in the ```test/``` folder.

## Basic level breakdown

* Level 1 - Introductions
* Level 2 - Model tests
* Level 3 - Refactoring and the 'shoulda' gem
* Level 4 - Mocks and stubs
